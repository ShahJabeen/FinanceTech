# FinanceTech

FinanceTech is a simple banking software, yet elegant piece of banking software with both 
administrative- and customer-facing interfaces, and quick, well-integrated functions that 
allow for a large database of customers and accounts.
It has a lot of features like view profile, view any account details such as  Chequing, 
Savings,Credit Card, Line of Credit. It also allows withdraws and transfers between the account. 

My contribution to the project was the Account class, its sub classes such as Chequing, Savings,
Credit Card, Line of Credit, Account Factory and RecTrans classes. All functions were incorporated 
by me and later uses by the interface class.
